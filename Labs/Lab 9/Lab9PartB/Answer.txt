Scenario: We have one to Many relation with Account and AccountEntry, when we fetch account the
AccountEntry will be fetched lazily. To print Account along with AccountEntry we did fetch tye
Eager for AccountEntry.

When we make all the methods of AccountService Transactional, we do not need to fetch the AccountEntry eagerly,
because the method getAccounts becomes Transactional, and the fetching of Account and AccountEntry is going to
happen on the same transaction, when the transaction get committed, the Account and list of AccountEntry both will
get fetched.
